1) To push our code to production, the code should be optimized (remove comments,
    remove console.log, have to minify the code)
2) Optimize images if app has one, a lot of processing needs to be done before you
    push code to production
3) Lot of other packages needed to create React fast, npm does not stand for node packages manager
4) There are 2 types of dependencies that we can install -dev dependencies and -normal dependencies
5) ^ => automatically updates to minor and patch latest version eg: 2.8.3 => 2.8.4 or 2.8.9 => 2.9.0
6) ~ => automatically updates to patch latest version eg: 2.8.3 => 2.8.4
7) when you want to know the exact version of installed package see package-lock.json
8) package.json is configuration file for npm
9) ignite our app using: npx parcel index.html
10) npx means executing the package
11) Normal JS file does not have import, so you have to tell that it is a module
12) Parcel does the following things for us
    - Dev build
    - Local server
    - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) reload brower on save
    - Image optimization
    - Minification
    - Bundling
    - Compress
    - Differential bundling (support for older browser)
13) Tree shaking (remove unused code)
