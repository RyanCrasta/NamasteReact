LECTURE 5: LET’S GET HOOKED

1) The best practice is to make separate files for separate components.

2) You can either use .js or .jsx extension.

3) Put all the CONSTANTS in a utils folder

4) There are 2 different types of exports default and named export. When you have to export multiple things use named export. In one file you can only write on default export.

5) While importing use Curly brackets and exact name if you are using default export. If you are using default export just use any name while importing.

6) React is faster because it can do quick DOM manipulation.

7) A hook is just a normal JS function given to us by React.

8) Whenever a state variable updates, React rerenders the component.

9) React creates a virtual DOM from the component tree, it is a representation of the actual DOM.

10) Diffing Algorithm: Finds out the difference between two Virtual DOM’s.
